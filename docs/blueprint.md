I want you to build me an app where i can manage my sales. I have District office, Branch office and officers at branch i want to give sales lead task for Branches... Branches then give the specific task to individual by setting the sales place on Google map... Then after setting the tasks the individual will receive the task details including the sales place he is expected to visit and on reporting back i want to confirm that the person is on the same place at reporting time... With multiple update on the sales lead the officer might close the case with his explanation further expecting case closure at branch level and district level. The task can also be reopened by the branch manager ot district manager wuth further tasks on the sales lead.
